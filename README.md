# GRNLR
## sample based granular synthesizer
**GRNLR** is a quasisyncronous sample based granular synthesizer. It is an adaptation of
a synthesizer I wrote in SuperCollider and the approach is inspired by Curtis Roads book
*"Microsound"*.

GRNLR is not just an open source granular synthesizer but also a
 [tutorial](https://github.com/passivist/GRNLR/blob/master/Tutorial.md)
on how to build a VST/AU plugin on the basis of a prototype in SuperCollider.
