# GRNLR
### developing a VST/AU plugin in the JUCE Framework
**GRNLR** is a quasisyncronous sample based granular synthesizer. It is an adaptation of
a synthesizer I wrote in SuperCollider and the approach is inspired by Curtis Roads book
*"Microsound"*.

GRNLR is the practical part of my bachelors thesis. This readme being the theoretical part
and also a tutorial on how to port a SuperCollider program to VST/AU using the JUCE Framework.
