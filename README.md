# GRNLR

**GRNLR** is an open source granular synthesis VST/AU instrument for Mac and Windows with a focus on flexibility and ease of use.
It offers a approach to granular synthesis that allows for a great number of simultaneous playing grains as well as supporting extremely short and long grains.
The instrument comes with a [tutorial](https://github.com/passivist/GRNLR/wiki) documenting every stage of the development process. The tutorial is intended as a resource for people wanting to learn how to write their own instruments using the [JUCE Framework](https://www.juce.com/).

Here is a playlist of [7 short pieces](https://soundcloud.com/raffael_seyfried/sets/grnlr-etudes) I wrote using the plugin.
